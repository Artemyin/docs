# Instant wallet

**You can use instant wallet to authorize the user without leaving the site.**

We wrote a small library which is fully compatible with wallet selector. We can use it to show a QR code to the user. As soon as he scans the QR code, it will trigger a successful sub-operation and return the result of the transaction

## @herewallet/near-selector

{% embed url="https://github.com/here-wallet/near-selector" %}

This library allows you to interact asynchronously with the here-wallet together with the near-selector.

In contrast to the synchronous signing of transactions in MyNearWallet and official near wallet, where the user is redirected to the wallet site for signing -- _HERE Wallet_ provides the ability to sign transactions using async/await API calls.

```
npm i near-api-js@^0.44.2
npm i @near-wallet-selector/core --save
npm i @here-wallet/near-selector --save
```

### Usage

```
import "@near-wallet-selector/modal-ui/styles.css";
import { setupWalletSelector } from "@near-wallet-selector/core";
import { setupNearWallet } from "@near-wallet-selector/near-wallet";
import { setupModal } from "@near-wallet-selector/modal-ui";
import { HereWallet, setupHereWallet } from "@here-wallet/near-selector";

const selector = await setupWalletSelector({
  modules: [setupNearWallet(), setupHereWallet()],
  network: "mainnet",
});

// Force login with here-wallet easy!
const here = await selector.wallet<HereWallet>("here-wallet");
const accounts = await here.signIn({ contractId: "social.near" });

console.log(`Hello ${accounts[0].accountId}!`);
```

### How it works

By default, all near-selector api calls that you make with this library run a background process and generate a unique link that the user can go to their mobile wallet and confirm the transaction. This is a link of the form: [https://web.herewallet.app/approve?request\_id=UUID4](https://web.herewallet.app/approve?request\_id=UUID4)

If a user has logged into your application from a phone and has a wallet installed, we immediately transfer him to the application for signing. In all other cases, we open a new window on the web.herewallet.app site, where the user can find information about installing the wallet and sign the transaction there.

All this time while user signing the transaction, a background process in your application will monitor the status of the transaction requested for signing.

### Instant Wallet with AppClip

If your goal is to provide the user with a convenient way to log in to your desktop app, you can use Here Instant Wallet, which allows users without a wallet to instantly create one via appclip.

> At the moment here wallet is only available for IOS users

You have the option to override how your user is delivered the signing link. This is how you can create a long-lived transaction signature request and render it on your web page:

```
import QRCode from "qrcode";

const result = await here.signAndSendTransaction({
  receiverId: "social.near",
  actions: [...],

  forceRedirect: false, // Disable default behaviour
  onInitialized: (link) => QRCode.toCanvas(document.getElementById("qrcode"), link);
  onApproving: () => console.log("The user pressed the approve button in the wallet!")
});
```

You can also look at an example in this repository /example/index.ts or in sandbox: [https://codesandbox.io/s/here-wallet-instant-app-6msgmn](https://codesandbox.io/s/here-wallet-instant-app-6msgmn)

### Async Methods

Methods **signIn**, **signAndSendTransaction**, **signAndSendTransactions** have additional parameters:

```
export interface AsyncHereSignDelegate {
  // If false, then the library will not try to redirect the user to the wallet
  forceRedirect?: boolean;

  // Called after the signing link is generated
  onInitialized?: (link: string) => void;

  // Will be called when the user presses the confirmation button in their wallet.
  // This can help make your interface more responsive, 
  // for example you can add a loading animation until the transaction is completed
  onApproving?: (link: string) => void;
}
```

### Near Selector

This library was created to speed up development, the most stable version of this module will be available in the official @near-selector/here-wallet library in the future!
