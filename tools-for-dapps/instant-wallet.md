# Instant wallet

You can use instant wallet to authorize the user without leaving the site.

We wrote a small library which is fully compatible with wallet selector. We can use it to show a QR code to the user

as soon as he scans the QR code, it will trigger a successful sub-operation and return the result of the transaction
