# Score

**Score** is a rating of activity in the app. It is attached to an account and cannot be sent to friends or bought for money. It consists of a permanent and a variable part. Permanent is accumulated for the use of certain features / contests / inviting friends and can only increase. Dynamic part depends on the balance or amount of money in steaking and can change.

## What gives a high score?

1\. **Private features**. New features are unlocked in the app after reaching the score threshold. You can earn USDT and get gifts for the found bugs

2\. **+APY**. The more score, the more profit you get from staking. Up to 10.2% per annum!

3\. **Cashback**. Users with score higher than 3000 can do gas free transactions between friends, get cashback for swaps, and purchase of some NFTs

## **Levels:**

**0–100** — I am not a bot 🤖\
**100–1300** — Start earn more APY, +0.1% for each 100 score 💸\
**400, 600, 1000, 2500** — Unlocking a secret feature 🔐\
**2000** —God mode. Gas free transactions / cashback for swaps ☁️
