# NEAR Foundation

In early June, the NEAR Foundation awarded a **$50,000** grant to develop the HERE Wallet. We're making the first mobile wallet for NEAR Protocol, which will make NEAR even more accessible and closer to people. Now you don't need a computer to use all the features of NEAR and interact with dApp.

In addition to access to NEAR transfers and purchases, the app supports important ecosystem projects. Liquid Stacking is available for all HERE Wallet users to start earning income in NEAR in one click. Quick NEAR buying and selling for bitcoin is also available. All of these features enable basic users to take full advantage of the NEAR ecosystem

The grant will help the HERE Wallet team finish development and pass security checks. The NEAR Foundation team supports a lot of important ecosystem projects. This has a great impact on user interest in the platform and helps its development. We are excited to be a part of the NEAR Foundation grants program.

Now there is a B-version of the app in TestFlight, and it will launch on the Apple Store at the end of July. You can add it to the waiting list at the project's official website herewallet.app. NEAR is HERE
